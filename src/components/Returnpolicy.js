      <h3 className="return-title">Exchanges & Returns</h3>
      <p>
        We offer exchanges and returns within <strong className="bold-text">7 days from the date of delivery</strong>. Once your exchange/return query has been accepted by our team, a notification will be sent to your registered email, and your order will be picked up by our logistics partner within <strong className="bold-text">24-48 hours</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pickup will be attempted twice. If the courier partner is unable to pick up the shipment, you will need to send the shipment back to the warehouse address. Reverse pickup is subject to availability in your area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your order at the warehouse, it will undergo a <strong className="bold-text">Quality Check</strong>. Once approved, your exchange/return query will be processed further. Estimated delivery of all exchange queries falls between <strong className="bold-text">7-10 working days</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an exchange in size cannot be fulfilled due to stock availability, we will either exchange it for another product or issue store credit, which can be used at any of our locations or on your next online purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all return orders, refunds will be issued in the form of a <strong className="bold-text">credit note</strong> once the product passes QC. This will be shared with you via your registered email address.
      </p>
